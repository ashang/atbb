我们失去了一位勇士，一位伟人，

万维网的发明者蒂姆•伯纳斯-李在葬礼上发表悼词

Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of world wide web
在twitter上说:
"Aaron dead. World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down. Parents all, we have lost a child. Let us weep."

Aaron死了。
我们失去了一位智慧的长者，这个世界陷入迷茫。
向往正义的创造者们，我们一起陷落了。
所有父母亲啊，我们都失去了一位孩子。
让我们哀哭吧。

Yeah we wept when we remembered Aaron．

在"当检察官成为霸凌"的博客中写道："那个人（斯沃茨）在今日离开人世，而将他逼上绝路的行为在一个体面社会中只能称作是霸凌。我懂得什么是错误。我懂得什么是罪罚相称。如果你不懂这两者，那么你不配拥有美国政府授予你的权力"

Lawrence Lessig, Harvard law professor and ex-mentor

blogs: "Here is where we need a better sense of justice, and shame. For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor's behaviour.

From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterise what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The "property" Aaron had "stolen," we were told, was worth "millions of dollars"- with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime.

这是正义的耻辱，荒谬。

葬礼上，Aaron的女友哽咽着说，他渴望社会得到改变，远胜于他对金钱和名誉的诉求。

亚伦的死亡不单是个人的悲剧，它是司法系统中充斥着恐吓和过分检控的产物。
马萨诸塞州的美国联邦检察官办公室和麻省理工学院的官员所作出的决定导致他的死亡。

Here's the full statement, which was also published on a site the family created to memorialize Aaron, [rememberaaronsw.com](http://rememberaaronsw.com/):

Our beloved brother, son, friend, and partner Aaron Swartz hanged himself on Friday in his Brooklyn apartment. We are in shock, and have not yet come to terms with his passing.

Aaron's insatiable curiosity, creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable—these gifts made the world, and our lives, far brighter. We're grateful for our time with him, to those who loved him and stood with him, and to all of those who continue his work for a better world.

Aaron's commitment to social justice was profound, and defined his life. He was instrumental to the defeat of an Internet censorship bill; he fought for a more democratic, open, and accountable political system; and he helped to create, build, and preserve a dizzying range of scholarly projects that extended the scope and accessibility of human knowledge. He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. His deeply humane writing touched minds and hearts across generations and continents. He earned the friendship of thousands and the respect and support of millions more.

Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death. The US Attorney's office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims. Meanwhile, unlike JSTOR, MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and its own community's most cherished principles.

Today, we grieve for the extraordinary and irreplaceable man that we have lost.

斯沃茨的家人和合作伙伴创建的纪念网站上，他们发表声明说，"作为一个程序员和技术人员，他不是用惊人的技巧使自己富足，而是使网际网路和世界成为一个更公平，更美好的地方。"

作家科利•多克托罗写道："亚伦的政治观点、技术及对人和对议题的理解能力是无与伦比的结合。我认为他已经彻底改变了美国的政治。

看看那些让狭义的同行们感激的贡献
