<p>- Arnold Toynbee, Experiences</p>
<p>		"Americans spend an average of four hours a day watching TV, an hour of that enduring ads. That adds up to an astounding 10% of total leisure time; at current rates, a typical viewer fritters away three years of his life getting bombarded with commercials."</p>
<p>- Scott Woolley, Forbes</p>
<p>		"The best writing is rewriting."</p>
<p>- E. B. White</p>

<p>		"In France those absurd perversions of the art of war which covered themselves under the name of chivalry were more omnipotent than in any other country of Europe. The strength of the armies of Philip and John of Valois was composed of a fiery and undisciplined aristocracy which imagined itself to be the most efficient military force in the world, but which was in reality little removed from an armed mob."</p>
<p>- C. W. C. Oman, The Art of War in the Middle Ages</p>

<p>- Tara Ploughman</p>

<p>		"Many who burnt heretics in the ordinary way of their business were otherwise excellent people."</p>

<p>- Jean Gimpel, The Medieval Machine, 1975</p>
<p>		"Politics is not the art of the possible. It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable."</p>

<p>- Robert Bennett, English professor at Montana State, announcing a panel discussion about Brad Pitt</p>
<p>		"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist."</p>

<p>		"As all these results were obtained, not by any heroic method, but by patient and detailed reasoning, I began to think it probable that philosophy had erred in adopting heroic remedies for intellectual difficulties, and that solutions were to be found merely by greater care and accuracy. This view I have come to hold more and more strongly as time went on, and it has led me to doubt whether philosophy, as a study distinct from science and possessed of a method of its own, is anything more than an unfortunate legacy from theology."</p>
