> Dedicated to Joel 'Espy' Klecker

> On July 11, 2000, the Debian Project, and the Free Software Community as a
> whole, lost a very dear friend and developer. For most of Joel's life he
> had been fighting a disease known as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Since
> July of 1997, Joel has been a Debian developer, and for most of that time
> was bed-ridden because of this disease. Joel was 21 when he died, far from
> the ripe age we imagine most people in our field will reach. His great
> dedication to the project is an inspiration to us all, and will never be
> forgotten.
>
> He was known by most of us as "Espy", his IRC nickname, and also as the
> outspoken voice we heard on the mailing lists, never afraid to speak his
> mind in a way that only Joel could do, with humor and directness. He
> maintained a level of excellence in many important packages for Debian.
> His expertise and knowledge was never questioned. Those of us who have
> the honor of carrying on the work that he has done for us, will try to
> maintain it to his degree of technical perfection.
>
> Most of us had no idea the trials that Joel endured every day of his
> life. Not until near the end did any of us know he even had this disease.
> Only now are we realizing his dedication, and the friendship that he
> bestowed upon us. So as a show of our appreciation, and in memory of his
> inspirational life, this release of Debian is for him.

> Joel Klecker's Opening Speech
> I've never written anything like this before, so if it seems rambling and incoherent, bite me. :P
> 
> A chronic problem in Debian has been our overly long release cycle, if elected, this shall be my major focus. To start with, I shall appoint a group responsible for release engineering as I feel that one person cannot adequately deal with the sheer mass of release critical bugs as well as the archive maintenance tasks and the sheer thanklessness of the job.
> 
> Another related issue is the number of absentee developers and the difficulty in forcibly orphaning their packages. It is my intent to appoint a group whose mission shall be to search out and remove inactive developers (with very strict guidelines of course).
> 
> One other problem I want to address is the amount of useless packages in Debian, our goal should not be to package every piece of free software in the world no matter how useless. I'm not sure of the best way to approach this problem or how to solve it, but it will be something I'll investigate.
> 
> I also want to get some sort of proficiency test into the new-maintainer process, but I'm unsure of the logistics of this.
> 
> In conclusion, I promise to rock the cabal to its very foundation and to rid Debian of the unworthy. :-)
> 
> To those of you still with me, please set down your crack pipes.
> 
> Fine, want more? OK then... I promise to acquire mucho more elite hardware to start cool flamewars with and to alienate as many current donor admins as possible in the process.
> 
> I promise black helicopters and world-killing weapons for everyone.
> 
> The streets will flow with the blood of the non-believers!
> 
> Remember that I maintain glibc, so vote for me or else!
>

In a never-ending effort to burn myself out, I hereby announce
that I have gone insane^W^W^Wam running for Supreme Debian
Overlord^W^W^WDPL.

I am 21 years old in earth years, male, and human (however, my
soul belongs to glibc).

I've been a developer for about 2 years now. I currently
maintain glibc and ncurses (as well as a few less important
packages); I'm a member of the Debian GCC Maintainers and a
SPARC and PowerPC porter.

I am not now, nor have I ever been a member of The Cabal(tm)
(TINC).

(Note: Despite the non-serious tone of this, I am serious ;-)

## reminiscing

> On July 11th, 2000, Joel Klecker (also known as Espy) passed away at 21 years of age. No one who saw 'Espy' in #mklinux, the Debian lists or channels knew that behind this nickname was a young man suffering from a form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Most people only knew him as 'the Debian glibc and powerpc guy' and had no idea of the hardships Joel fought. Though physically impaired, he shared his great mind with others.

> Joel Klecker (Espy) will be missed.

> Several Debian Developers have submitted this, and I'm sorry for the delay. I just didn't want to rush something like this: Joel Klecker has passed on. I never knew his real name, but as Espy, he answered lots of dumb questions for me on IRC over the years. The Internet makes connections between people from around the world, but from opposite sides of a dozen routers, many things... like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy aren't readily apparent.
